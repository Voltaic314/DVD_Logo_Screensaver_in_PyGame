# DVD_Logo_Screensaver_in_PyGame
it's the DVD logo screensaver but in pygame, except the dvd logo is a little off and the background is teal instead of black.

This code kinda sucks and it's very stringy, messy, not testable, spaghetti code. But it's just a quick little thing I banged out for fun while I was trying to make pong. So eh. Just enjoy it for what it is! lol 

you'll need all the files in this directory (other than the readme) to make this work. And you'll also need to pip install pygame in your terminal in the same directory as the files for it to work as well. Otherwise it should work. :)
